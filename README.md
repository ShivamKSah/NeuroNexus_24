## 🏥 Hackathon Pitch

Welcome to the future of healthcare management! The SRM Hospital Supporter System is a revolutionary platform that transforms how hospitals operate, doctors diagnose, nurses care, and patients heal. Our system seamlessly integrates AI-powered insights with intuitive workflows to create a truly smart hospital ecosystem.

### 🚀 The Problem

Traditional hospital systems suffer from:
- Fragmented patient information across departments
- Inefficient bed management and patient flow
- Time-consuming manual processes for prescriptions and reports
- Lack of real-time insights for clinical decision-making
- Poor patient engagement and understanding of their health

### 💡 Our Solution

We've built a comprehensive hospital management system that addresses all these pain points with cutting-edge technology and thoughtful design:
